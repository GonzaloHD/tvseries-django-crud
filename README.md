# tvseries-django-crud-restapi

TV Series Django WebApp interacts with a REST API focused on TV Series. 

It's possible to perform CRUD operations to update and edit TV series information and its characters.

When creating a new series, you can click on 'suggest series' to get a list of suggested series using the OpenAI API (for this purpose, an active OpenAI Token is required).
